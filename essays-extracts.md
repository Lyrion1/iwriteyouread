# The World’s Whisper

## An extract from *The Spirit of America: Views from the Other Side*

This section presents selected essays and book extracts examining democracy, power, and America’s global meaning.

There was a time when to be American was to be watched not with suspicion, but with awe.

Not because the United States was flawless, but because it appeared committed to something larger than itself. The American story, though scarred and incomplete, projected a vision of possibility. Not merely of wealth, but of freedom. Not dominance, but dignity. It suggested that a society could argue with itself openly and still endure.

For much of the world, America was not just a country. It was a signal.

That signal has not disappeared. But it has weakened.

Today, America is still watched intensely but the gaze has changed. What the world now sees is not a beacon so much as a battleground. Not a model to emulate, but a warning to interpret.

This change matters far beyond U.S. borders.

Because America’s greatest export was never its military or its money. It was an example.

### The Global Mirror

In London pubs and Lagos classrooms, in cafés from Rio to Rome, the same question surfaces quietly:

What happened to them?

What happened to the nation that once spoke of freedom as a universal inheritance? That landed men on the moon while insisting that power required justification? That told the world, repeatedly, that democracy was difficult but worth it?

The question is rarely asked with mockery. More often, it is asked with something closer to grief.

For decades, America functioned as a kind of moral reference point. Not because it was always right, but because it seemed willing to correct itself in public. It treated error not as weakness, but as evidence that the system was alive.

Now, from the outside, that self-correction looks stalled.

A former president labels the press “the enemy.” 
Political violence is normalised, then rationalised. 
Judges are threatened. 
Books are banned. 
Elections are doubted before votes are cast. 
Science is treated as opinion.

To much of the world, America no longer looks exceptional. It looks familiar and uncomfortably so. Like Hungary. Like Turkey. Like Brazil at its worst moments.

The fear is not that America is collapsing.

The fear is that America is becoming ordinary.

Also, if even the world’s most established democracy can slide into grievance, tribalism, and disbelief, what hope do the rest have?

### The Authoritarian Echo

Around the globe, illiberal leaders have learned a new rhetorical trick: point to America.

Victor Orbán gestures toward U.S. campus unrest to justify censorship. 
China’s state media cites January 6th as proof that democracy is chaos. 
Russian propagandists highlight America’s racial divisions to dismiss human rights. 
In Brazil, Bolsonaro’s supporters echoed MAGA rhetoric nearly word for word during their attempted coup.

America has become a citation.

Not as a shining city on a hill, but as a cautionary tale.

This reversal is not merely ironic. It is dangerous.

For much of the postwar world, America’s power rested not in its weapons, but in its moral imagination. It said, implicitly and sometimes explicitly: *We are imperfect, but we strive.*

The message now heard abroad is different: *We are tribal and we fight.*

Also, when democracy loses confidence in itself, authoritarianism does not need to persuade. It only needs to wait.

### The Democratic Retreat

In 2024, Freedom House reported that global democracy had declined for the seventeenth consecutive year. Even in long established democracies, trust is eroding.

France battles far-right insurgencies. 
India jails journalists and narrows dissent. 
The United Kingdom oscillates between technocracy and nostalgic populism. 
Israel, once a proud democratic experiment, is mired in constitutional crisis.

These nations once looked to America not for instructions, but for cues. For reassurance that self-government, though messy, could survive.

Now they look elsewhere.

Toward China’s promise of authoritarian efficiency. 
Toward Russia’s strategic cynicism. 
Toward Orbán’s model of “illiberal democracy.”

The American idea is being outbid, not with weapons, but with certainty.

Democracy’s great weakness has always been doubt. Its great strength was that it tolerated it. When that tolerance disappears, democracy begins to imitate the systems it once opposed.

America must decide whether it still wishes to be a model or merely a market.

### The Quiet Hope

Also, yet, even in this dusk, a whisper persists.

In Hong Kong, activists still quote Martin Luther King Jr. 
In Ukraine, American and Ukrainian flags fly side by side. 
In Nigeria, protest chants borrow the cadence of “Yes We Can.” 
In Iran, women risking their lives shout “freedom” a word learned from American films, books, and songs.

America may forget itself.

The world has not.

Not the empire. Not the bombs. Not the brands.

The idea.

The idea that the individual matters. That law stands above the ruler. That liberty, however chaotic, is worth the labour it demands.

The world whispers this idea even when Americans shout over it.

Also, in that whisper lies both indictment and faith.

### America as Pilgrimage

To this day, tens of thousands still attempt to migrate to the United States. Not for perfection. But for possibility.

For self-authorship.

For the belief, however battered, that a person might still write their own ending.

For much of the world, America remains a kind of pilgrimage site. Not because it has fulfilled its promise, but because it has not entirely abandoned it.

That is the burden America carries.

Not to be flawless. 
But to be faithful.

Because if the republic dies, it will not die alone. It will take something universal with it, the fragile belief that people can govern themselves without certainty, without kings, without fear.

But if America can remember that it was never meant to be finished

If it can recover its tolerance for doubt, disagreement, and unfinished work 

Then the world will hear more than a whisper.

It will hear music again.
